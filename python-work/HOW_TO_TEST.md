## 📋 Testing Approaches

### 1. **Automated Testing** (For Developers)

#### Run All Tests
```bash
# Install dependencies and run comprehensive tests
python run_tests.py
```

#### Run Specific Test Components
```bash
# Test only skills extraction
python -m pytest tests/test_endtoend_model.py::TestEndToEndModel::test_skills_extraction_pipeline -v

# Test only job matching
python -m pytest tests/test_endtoend_model.py::TestEndToEndModel::test_job_matching_pipeline -v

# Test with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/test_endtoend_model.py --cov=ai_models --cov-report=html
```

#### Manual Component Testing
```python
# Test skills extraction
from ai_models.skills_extractor import extract_and_normalize
skills = extract_and_normalize("Python developer with AWS experience")
print(skills)  # ['python', 'aws']

# Test job matching
from ai_models.job_matcher import match_jobs
matches = match_jobs({"raw_text": "Python developer..."})
print(matches)  # [{'job': 'Backend Developer', 'score': 0.85}, ...]

# Test career recommendations
from ai_models.career_recommender import recommend_career
recs = recommend_career(['python', 'aws'])
print(recs)  # ['Backend Developer', 'Data Scientist']

# Test feedback generation
from ai_models.feedback_generator import generate_feedback
feedback = generate_feedback(skills, matches, recs)
print(feedback)  # Detailed feedback string
```

### 2. **Interactive Testing** (For Users)

#### Text-Based Testing
```bash
python demo_model.py
# Choose option 4 for interactive testing
```

Example inputs to test:
```
# Data Scientist
Python developer with 5 years experience in machine learning, TensorFlow, pandas, numpy, SQL, and AWS. Built predictive models for customer behavior analysis.

# Frontend Developer

# DevOps Engineer
DevOps engineer with expertise in AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, and cloud infrastructure. Experienced in automation.
```

#### File-Based Testing
```bash
# Test with a resume file
python demo_model.py --file path/to/your/resume.pdf
```

### 3. **Complete Pipeline Testing**

#### Test the Full Pipeline
```python
from main_ai import analyze_resume

# Test with a resume file
result = analyze_resume("path/to/resume.pdf")
print(result)
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "parsed_text": "JOHN DOE Software Engineer...",
  "skills": ["python", "aws", "docker", "machine learning"],
  "job_matches": [
    {"job": "Data Scientist", "score": 0.85},
    {"job": "Backend Developer", "score": 0.72}
  ],
  "career_recommendations": ["Data Scientist", "Backend Developer"],
  "feedback": "Detected skills: python, aws, docker, machine learning..."
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Testing

### Performance Testing
```python
import time
from ai_models.skills_extractor import extract_and_normalize

# Test with large text
large_text = "Python " * 1000 + "AWS " * 500 + "Docker " * 300

start_time = time.time()
skills = extract_and_normalize(large_text)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Processing time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Skills found: {len(skills)}")
```

### Error Handling Testing
```python
# Test with invalid inputs
from ai_models.skills_extractor import extract_and_normalize

# Empty text
print(extract_and_normalize(""))  # Should return []

# None input
print(extract_and_normalize(None))  # Should return []

# Non-string input
print(extract_and_normalize(123))  # Should return []
```

### File Parsing Testing
```python
from ai_models.resume_parser import parse_resume

# Test with non-existent file
try:
    result = parse_resume("nonexistent.pdf")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("✅ File not found error handled correctly")

# Test with unsupported format
try:
    result = parse_resume("file.txt")
except ValueError:
    print("✅ Unsupported format error handled correctly")
```

   # Use raw strings for Windows paths
   file_path = r"C:\Users\Username\Desktop\resume.pdf"
   ```

4. **Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Run tests with verbose output
   python -m pytest tests/test_endtoend_model.py -v -s
   ```

## 📈 Test Metrics

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All 13 test cases pass
- ✅ Skills extraction accuracy > 80%
- ✅ Job matching relevance > 70%
- ✅ Processing time < 5 seconds for typical resumes
- ✅ Error handling works for all edge cases

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Small resume (100 words)**: < 1 second
- **Medium resume (500 words)**: < 2 seconds
- **Large resume (1000+ words)**: < 5 seconds
- **Memory usage**: < 100MB for typical processing

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Test Regularly**: Run tests after any code changes
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Always test with empty, invalid, or extreme inputs
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track processing time and memory usage
4. **Validate Output**: Ensure results are meaningful and actionable
5. **Document Issues**: Keep track of any bugs or unexpected behavior

## 🚀 Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. **Deploy the model** to production environment
2. **Monitor real-world usage** and collect feedback
3. **Iterate and improve** based on user feedback
4. **Add more test cases** as new features are developed
5. **Scale testing** to handle larger datasets
